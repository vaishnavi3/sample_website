    <h3>Lee Donahoe</h3>
    <p>When he's not literally swimming with sharks or hunting powder stashes
      on his snowboard, you can find Lee in front of his computer designing
      interfaces, doing front-end development, or writing some of the
      interface-related Learn Enough tutorials.
      You should follow Lee on Twitter
     <a href="https://twitter.com/leedonahoe">here</a>.

    <h3>Nick Merwin</h3>

    <p>
      You may have seen him shredding guitar live with Capital Cities on Jimmy
      Kimmel, Conan, or The Ellen Show, but rest assured Nick is a true nerd
      at heart. He's just as happy shredding well-spec'd lines of code from a
      tour bus as he is from his kitchen table.
