<p>hello world!

<strong>Learn Enough to Be Dangerous </strong>is a leader in the movement to teach
     technical sophistication, the seemingly magical ability to take
     command of your computer and get it to do your bidding. This includes
     everything from command lines and coding to guessing keyboard shortcuts,
     Googling error messages, and knowing when to just reboot the darn thing.
     We believe there are at least a billion people who can benefit from
     learning <em>technical sophistication</em>, probably more. To join our
     movement, sign up for our official email list now.</p>
